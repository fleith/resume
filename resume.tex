\section{PROFILE}       Significant experience in software development using different approaches. I have worked in Linux, Windows platforms, and in some embedded systems. Most of the time my programming language is C++, but over the years I have used Python and other languages. I am motivated by challenges, for learn new things, and coding the future.
