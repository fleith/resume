\section{PROFILE}       I am a result driven software developer involved in different approaches. I have worked on both Linux and Windows platforms, as well as on embedded systems. My main programming language is C++, but over the years I have used Python and other languages. I am motivated by challenges, by learning new things, and coding the future.
