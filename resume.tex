\section{PROFILE}       Significant experience in software development using different approaches. I have worked in Linux, Windows platforms, and in some embedded systems. Most of the time my programming language is C++, but over the years I have used Python and other languages. I am motivated by challenges, for learn new things, and coding the future.

                   \item Working in fashion and apparel products for improve the clients efficiency. At that time I had worked in some projects like CAD/CAM/Design software wrote in C++ language. The most challenge was improve legacy code into a new reusable and better for maintenance, using technics like TDD, Continuous Integration, and others. When the team was migrating the legacy code we had to dealing with the schedule to add new features. (Qt, MVC, CMake, Jenkins, GitLab, Python, CI, CD, SVG, i18n, etc.)
